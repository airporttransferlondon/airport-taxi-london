      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Why Book an Airport Taxi in London?</h2>
      <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
        London airports are some of the busiest in the UK. Travelling with luggage or in large groups 
        can be stressful when relying on public transport. Booking a <a href="https://minicabs.co.uk/airport-transfer" class="text-blue-600">airport taxi</a> means a door-to-door journey, 
        no delays, and the comfort of knowing your driver will be ready when you land.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Fixed Fares and Transparent Pricing</h2>

        Unlike traditional black cabs that charge by the meter, private hire taxi services in London offer 
        fixed fares. This ensures you know the cost upfront, with no hidden surprises, even if traffic delays occur.
